# 2-3-tree
Complete implementation of 2 3 tree using java 

## Data Structure 
Data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Tree
Tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure,
with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.


## 2 3 tree
A 2–3 tree is a tree data structure, where every node with children (internal node) has either two children (2-node)
and one data element or three children (3-nodes) and two data elements. According to Knuth, "a B-tree of order 3 is a 2-3 tree."

## Fils in project 
### Dataitem 
Contain the type of data to be used for implementation in tree. In this project type "long" is used but you can change it according to your convenience
### Node23 
This file contains the implementation of node in a tree A tree is a collection of entities called nodes . ... Each node contains a value or data , and it may or may not have a child node . The first node of the tree is called the root . If this root node is connected by another node , the root is then a parent node and the connected node is a child .
### Tree23App
It contain the main method of the project file where values and various scenarios are implemented in 2 3 tree
### Tree23
It has the actual implementation of 2 3 tree by using Node23 class
